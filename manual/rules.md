# Upgrade

* There are two teams - you and the person opposite to you are always on the same team
* One team 

# Phases

1. Deal phase

In first round - 

Once you get the "special number" then you can choose to show it - then you are the team who tries to win.

6 cards are left in middle. The person who showed the 2 can swap with the middle. They can't leave more than 25 in the middle. They show the 6 cards in middle (before and after they switch).

In all rounds -

showing the "special number" determines trump.

2. Playing phase

Now, the switching team has a great hand. Two conditions:

a) Other team doesn't win more than 40 points
b) Other team doesn't win the last round 

If both true, it's an upgrade.
It one is true, nothing, but other team gets to start.

Rules:
* follow suit if can
* joker is trump - can only be played in trump round
* highest card wins
* other than single cards, the following are possible:
    * if you have biggest in suit, you can play multiple. IF YOU are not sure, and try this and fail you automatically play the lowest of that suit. all trump must be played against a non multi trump highest hand.
    * also, you can play 4 of a kind. if 4 of a kind is original, they play up to 4 trump and then other cards if they have trump. highest 4 of a kind is guaranteed win. if non special 4 of kind, you must play one of each suit.
    * no bombs in this game

Scoring:

* 5, 10 and King are points (5 is 5 points, 10 and King are 10 points). Maximum of 100 points, so 60 or more is good. Scoring is just what level you are on. It goes up to Ace.
